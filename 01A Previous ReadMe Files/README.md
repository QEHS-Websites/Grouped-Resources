# Webpages and Sites
Computer Science Progression of Webpages to Websites

**CAUTION**: this is a previous Websites Document with all previous progressions

---

Usual Prior Experience
- Simple HTML or CSS

Special Projects and Considerations
- How Mercer's Kitchen mentors DIV II students to create a portfolio using HTML, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Website-Mentoring">Click Here for Website Mentoring</a>
- Creating a Development House's Website Testing Centre with Raspberry Pi's, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Webpages-Sites/blob/master/WebPageTest.pdf">See Website Test</a>

CAUTION: prototyping is the stuff of classroom lessons; moving to a professional feel requires searching and researching other people's work, constantly

## Project Progression

Creating a GitHub Repository, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository">Click Here</a>
- Note: try creating multiple Repositories for HelloWorld and then the assignments needed for the specific course
- For example:
  - HelloWorld
  - Who am I
  - Essay Project
  - JavaScript Lessons
  - Business Website Project
  - Main Project

Creating a Project Folder within a GitHub Repository, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Projects/Creating%20a%20GitHub%20Repository">Click Here</a>
- Note: two docs to write in to create content

# To Include

Intermediate HTML5 Additional Notes & Progress to Consider
- Develop Ideas about Variables and Data Structures
- Write Functions (non-return, return, nested)
- Develop outcomes about computation, operators, etc.
- Introduce various ways of writing variables: arrays and objects
- Complete JavaScript Lessons outputted to the console, for prototyping
- Build HTML-JavaScript Interactions using a Submit Button to run a JavaScript Function called main()
  - Connected to OOP concept of constructors and classes, but in procedural programming
- Build individual webpages of HTML Form Data Content connected to JavaScript Assignments
- Build a website of all JavaScript Assignments
  - Demonstration of code and links necessary to run multiple HTML & JavaScript Pages
- Note: this will lead into writing and linking CSS files

Include full links to CSS in Boilerplate, with debugging Lines

Which Data Structure makes sense
- Primitive data: individually initialized
- Objects: multiple values for primitive data, called keys
- Arrays: multiple elements for primitive data, controlled by a numeral

Use Ternary Operator as Full Solution

Use Forms to Input data

See: https://css-tricks.com/helping-a-beginner-understand-getting-a-website-live/

CSS lessons
- One page with different .class attributes, simple HTML
- Remember CSS Validation and Accessibility

Video 5 Notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wxRnsmNGpc&feature=youtu.be
- Making a Table: rows, colspan, rowspan (i.e. weekly schedule)
- Adding CSS to Table: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp
- More CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_tables.asp
- Example cell: font, font weight, color, background-color
- Note: background-color changes can increase contrast, making reading easier (not on white background)
- Note: in aXe validator, will analyze color contrast in Learn More
- Note: Checking Accessibility

Video 6 Notes
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwKOxh5hqQ&feature=youtu.be

This video developing a Form, what else needs to happen in Introductory?

Notes
- First build a Form
- Second, add colour with Style Sheets
- First is line to make sure nothing happens, for testing

- ensures nothing happens on the "x" html page, that doesn't exist

Build a Form in HTML: all typing is in Video, review the video again to add all the typing

Go to paletton.com; or http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

Get the triad and complimentary colours: time is about 7 minutes

Click on "Triad" and "Add Complimentary"

Look at definition for Compliementary Colour (opposite side of colour wheel)

Able to turn the colour wheel until we find colours we like, and can make darker or lighter

To get the colours, click on

Tables, Export

Colour List as CSS

Copy the first 3 Lines, including URL for Colour Scheme, paste into CSS File as reference

Pick the colours wanted, must pick the same numbers (all 0, or 1, or 2)

Make comments about primary, secondary, etc.

Copy the css export

create comment into css file

next create the foreground and background colours, then make sure they pass accessibility

Test the contrast using another Tool from aXe

https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/color-contrast?application=lighthouse

find one of colours to get the highest contrast ratio

Next, play with lightness of colours : changes hue and saturation

Question: do you want light on dark, or dark on light?

Make Comments about the new colours we will have

Continue to choose colours for the entire page

Colour Wheel: warm and cool colours
