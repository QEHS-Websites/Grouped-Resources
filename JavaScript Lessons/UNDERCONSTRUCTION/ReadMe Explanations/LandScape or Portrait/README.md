# Landscape or Portrait

**Under Construction**

Problem Situation -
- Input: width and height values
- Logic Of Situation
  - compare width and height to determine if display geometry is landscape, portrait, or square
- a

Output to the Console: concatenation to describe Boolean
- Boolean variable is true or false for landscape or portrait
- Boolean variable is true or false for landscape or portrait

Case Study Details
- Test Cases (boundaries of the Problem Situation)
- Greater or less than numbers
- Numbers are the same

Developing the Algorithm
- a

Starter Code to Consider
- Beginning Code
```JavaScript
function isLandscape (width, height) {
  return (width > height); //returns the value of the expression
}

let width = 800;
let height = 100;
console.log("This monitor geometry is Landscape:", isLandscape (width, height));
```

- Advanced Code
```JavaScript
function isLandscape (width, height) {
  if (width == height) return 'Square'; //must be first, return will not allow rest of code to run
  return (width > height) ? 'Landscape' : 'Portrait'; //ternary operator example
}

let width = 800;
let height = 800;
console.log("This display geometry is", isLandscape (width, height)); //Difference between calling functions with arguments and sending to parameter's, local variables
```

Reminder: use the tertiary operator
