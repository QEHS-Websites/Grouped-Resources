- Assignment order for those struggling with JavaScript
  - Landscape or Portrait: beginning and advanced code is given, <a href="">Click Here</a>
  - Max of Two Numbers: beginning code is given and uses advanced code from "Landscape or Portrait", <a href="">Click Here</a>
  - Ordering Grades: using if and return keywords to design functions, <a href="">concrete example</a>, <a href="">advanced examples</a>

# Ideas
Include index.html & index.js for all assignments not finished,
remember, these are the starter code assignments, not the finished products

Assignments should be formatted like

Problem Situation -
- Input
- Logic Of Situation
  - a
- a

Output to the Console
- a

Case Study Details
- Test Cases (boundaries of the Problem Situation)

Developing the Algorithm
- a

Starter Code to Consider
- a

Reminder: use the tertiary operator

# Ideas
Add the following JavaScript Assignments

See: <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/JavaScript-Sandbox/tree/master/IOP%20Computational%20Exercises#landscape-or-portrait">Click Here</a>
- Prime Numbers
- Even and Odd Numbers
- Count Truthy
- String Properties in an Object
- Sum of Multiples of 3 and 5
- Stars

Need a better way of introducing a lot of the arithmetic tracking
- handout like in math 1/2 page or 1 page?

Need better sequence to JavaScript Lessons
- Build code (functions, arrays, variables, constants, IF statements and importance of TRUE, order of RETURN)
- Build "arithmetic echoes"

Need to Map the Answers, especially the given code in the ReadMe.md File describing each .js assignment
- students need to understand the flow of the problem to translate the maths to code
